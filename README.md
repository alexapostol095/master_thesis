This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for my master's thesis. Data is not provided as it is private. All figures and outputs in the thesis are sourced from the outputs of this notebook. It begins with the importing libraries and the data sets. The regression framework is then set up and the data is engineered to create the per product database that the clustering will employ. A network is created, metrics are extracted, and the dataset is updated. After this, PCA is applied before being input into the clustering step. This is followed by accuracy calculations, cross-elasticity checks, and finally the regressions.
